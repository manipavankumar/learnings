function pointer: is a variable that stores the address of a function, 
allowing for dynamic function calls and greater flexibility in code execution.

Use Cases:

Callbacks: Function pointers enable passing functions as arguments, facilitating callback mechanisms. 
For instance, the qsort function in the C standard library uses a function pointer to determine the sorting order.
