POINTERS
pointer is a variable that stores memory address. Like all other varabiles it also should has name, has be to
declared and occupies some space in memory.it is called pointer because it points to the location in memory where
the address as been stored.

USES of POINTERS
- simulating call by reference 
- Returning more than one value from a function.
- Accessing dynamically allocated memory
- Implementing data structures like Linkedlist, trees, graphs

MEMORY 
-memory in computer is made up of bytes arranged in a sequential manner.
-Each byte is identified by an index number.

Dereferencing pointer:

-We have seen that while declaring a pointer variable, we have to mention the data type.the reason is that when we use 
 the indirection operator(*), the compiler will look at the base type of the pointer and will retrive the information
 depending on that base type.
-The size of pointer varabile is same for all type of pointers but the memory that will be accessed while Dereferencing
 is different.


POINTER ARITHMETIC:
-All types of arithmetic operations are not possible with pointers. the only valid operations are:
 1.addition of an integer to a pointer and increment operation.
 2.substraction of an integer from a pointer and decrement operation
 3.substraction of a pointer from another pointer of same type.
