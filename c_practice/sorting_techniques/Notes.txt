There are few sorting techniques each has its method of working, there is some criteria 
based on that we compare the sorting techniques and suitable for our requirement!

criteria for analysis:
1.Number of comparisons ->which decides the time complexity.
2.Number of Swaps -> here we will analyze how many swaps our sorting technique is performing.
3.Adaptive -> If sorting method is taking less time bcz of already arragned manner then we call it as adaptive 
4.stable  -> If there are any duplicate elements in the list then in the sorted list their order must be preserved!
5.Extra Memory 

BUBBLE sort:
~ bubble sort is simplest among other.Bubble sort works on the repeatedly swapping of adjacent elements until they are not in the intended order.
  Bubble sort meets all the above criteria (by nature bubble sort is not adaptive but we can made it as adaptive by using flag)
