Class Definition:

class MyClass: defines a new class named MyClass.
Constructor Method:

def __init__(self, value): is the constructor method (also known as the initializer). It is called when an instance of the class is created. It initializes the instance with a given value.
self.value = value sets the instance attribute value to the value passed when the instance is created.
Instance Methods:

def display_value(self): is a method that prints the value of the instance attribute value.
def set_value(self, new_value): is a method that sets the instance attribute value to a new value provided as an argument.
Creating an Instance:

obj = MyClass(10) creates an instance of MyClass with the initial value of 10.
Calling Methods:

obj.display_value() calls the display_value method on the instance obj, which prints the current value of value.
obj.set_value(20) calls the set_value method on the instance obj to change the value of value to 20.
Key Points
self Parameter:

The self parameter in the method definition refers to the instance calling the method. It allows access to the attributes and other methods of the class.
Instance Methods:

Methods that operate on an instance of the class and can access and modify the instance's attributes.
